we will add hilt when we will add the ViewModel

lets get a walking skeleton before writing End To End Test


API: https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=#term&media=music&entity=song

should I use ListAdapter??
    - In my opinion data will be new on each search, so it does not make sense to diff.
    - we can just go with regular recycler view adapter.


================= Challenge Doubts =================

- Should I search for artists or songs. On top challenge, it says Songs but below it says, 'search for an artist'?
    - going only for songs right now.
- Do I have to use the same API, or can I include the other query parameters in search as itunes api says
    so we are sure that results returned are of same type rather than mixed typed. Which it returns by default?
    - adding API parameters so we get only one type of results
- Third is can include material components. Since Android Studio's new Project already includes them?
    - just going to use material components
