add hilt and write fragment tests

should I write integration test for
   - keyboard is hidden when search is clicked on keyboard
   - drawable is hidden when focus is changed and there is not text
   - drawable clears the text on click
    - in my opinion let's test only this behaviour, other are more lean towards how it looks
        rather than any functionality. But this one is a behaviour we want.

lets get a walking skeleton before writing End To End Test


API: https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=#term&media=music&entity=song

I really want to fix the shadow in AppbarLayout...
    - but is getting late
    - will do it in last

should I use ListAdapter??
    - In my opinion data will be new on each search, so it does not make sense to diff.
    - we can just go with regular recycler view adapter.


================= Challenge Doubts =================

- Should I search for artists or songs. On top challenge, it says Songs but below it says, 'search for an artist'?
    - going only for songs right now.
- Do I have to use the same API, or can I include the other query parameters in search as itunes api says
    so we are sure that results returned are of same type rather than mixed typed. Which it returns by default?
    - adding API parameters so we get only one type of results
- Third is can include material components. Since Android Studio's new Project already includes them?
    - just going to use material components
